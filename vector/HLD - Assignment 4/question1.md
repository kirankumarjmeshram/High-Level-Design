**Scenario: You are designing a highly scalable and reliable e-commerce platform that expects high traffic during flash sales.**

**Tasks:**

**Scaling Strategy:**

* Identify and explain which scaling strategy (vertical or horizontal) you would choose for handling a sudden surge in traffic. Justify your choice with specific examples of how the system would scale.
* Discuss how you would use caching to improve scalability and reduce load on the database. Include details on what types of data you would cache and why.

**Load Balancing:**

* Design a load balancing strategy for the platform. Discuss different algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) and choose the most suitable one. Explain your choice and how it would handle varying traffic patterns.

**Handling Failures:**

* Propose a failover mechanism for the database to ensure the platform remains operational if the primary database fails. Describe the failover process and any trade-offs involved.
