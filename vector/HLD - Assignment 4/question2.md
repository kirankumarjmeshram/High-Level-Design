**Question 2:**

**Scenario: You are tasked with designing the backend for a critical real-time financial trading application that must operate with near-zero downtime.**

**Tasks:**

**Fault Tolerance:**

* Describe how you would implement redundancy in this system to avoid single points of failure. Include both hardware and software redundancy measures.
  Explain how you would use the circuit breaker pattern in your design to prevent cascading failures in the system. Provide a scenario in which the circuit breaker would be triggered.

**High Availability:**

* Propose a strategy for achieving high availability for the application. Consider the use of geographically distributed data centers and discuss how data consistency would be managed across these centers.
  Explain the differences between active-active and active-passive configurations and recommend one for this scenario. Justify your recommendation with pros and cons.

**Monitoring and Recovery:**

* Design a monitoring and alert system for detecting failures in the application. Identify key metrics to monitor (e.g., response times, error rates) and describe how alerts would be triggered and handled.
