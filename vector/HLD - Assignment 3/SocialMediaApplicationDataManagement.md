You are tasked with selecting a database for a new social media application that needs to store user profiles, posts, comments, likes, and friend relationships. The application must support complex queries, such as finding mutual friends, displaying a feed of recent posts, and suggesting friends.

a. Recommend a database solution that fits the needs of this social media application. Consider SQL, NoSQL (document, graph, column-family), and multi-model databases.
For a social media application with requirements for user profiles, posts, comments, likes, friend relationships, and complex queries, the optimal choice is a combination of a graph database and a document database. Specifically:
  
  1. Graph Database: Neo4j or Amazon Neptune
  2. Document Database: MongoDB or Couchbase

b. Justify your choice based on data relationships, query complexity, and scalability needs.
 **1 Data Relationships:**
   **Graph Database (Neo4j):**
      **Strengths**: Graph databases excel at handling and querying complex relationships and networks. In a social media application, relationships between users (e.g., friends, followers) are central, and graph databases are optimized for traversing these relationships efficiently. Queries such as finding mutual friends or suggesting new friends based on common connections are natural to graph databases and can be executed with high performance.
      **Example**: Neo4j's Cypher query language can easily handle traversals and path-based queries to identify mutual friends or suggest connections.
  **2 Query Complexity:**
    **Document Database (MongoDB):**      
        **Strengths**: Document databases provide flexibility for storing semi-structured data like posts, comments, and user profiles. They support fast read and write operations and allow for efficient indexing on various fields (e.g., timestamps for recent posts). MongoDB’s aggregation framework is powerful for generating feeds and handling complex queries related to posts and comments.
        **Example**: MongoDB can be used to store and query posts and comments efficiently, while also supporting indexes for quick retrieval of recent posts and likes.
  **3 Scalability Needs:**
    **Graph Database:**    
      **Scalability:** Graph databases can handle complex queries and large graphs with proper partitioning and clustering strategies. They may require specialized configurations for horizontal scaling.
      Example: Neo4j supports clustering and sharding, allowing it to scale out by distributing the graph data across multiple nodes.
    **Document Database:**
      **Scalability:** Document databases are designed for horizontal scaling and can handle high read and write throughput. They offer sharding to distribute data and load across multiple servers.
      **Example:** MongoDB supports automatic sharding to distribute data across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and scalability.
c. Describe how you would handle data sharding and replication to support a large number of concurrent users.
**1 Data Sharding:**
  
  **Graph Database (Neo4j):**
     **Sharding Strategy:** While Neo4j does not have built-in sharding in the traditional sense, data can be partitioned based on logical boundaries such as user regions or friend clusters. This approach helps distribute the graph’s load.
     **Implementation**: Use a combination of manual sharding and Neo4j’s clustering features to manage large graphs. You may split the graph into smaller, manageable pieces based on user activity or geographic regions.
  
  **Document Database (MongoDB):**
      **Sharding Strategy:** MongoDB uses sharding to distribute data across multiple servers. Choose a shard key that optimizes the distribution of data and balances the load.
      **Implementation:** For example, shard user profiles and posts based on user IDs or geographic regions. MongoDB automatically distributes data and queries across shards, ensuring scalability.
  
 **2 Data Replication:**
    **Graph Database (Neo4j):**
      **Replication Strategy:** Configure Neo4j clustering with multiple replicas to ensure high availability. The cluster consists of a single leader (primary) and multiple followers (replicas) to handle read requests and failover.
      **Implementation:** Regularly backup the database and ensure that replicas are synchronized with the leader to maintain data consistency and availability.
    **Document Database (MongoDB):**
      **Replication Strategy:** Use replica sets in MongoDB to ensure high availability. Each replica set consists of a primary node and multiple secondary nodes that replicate the data from the primary.
      **Implementation:** Set up replica sets to provide redundancy and automatic failover. MongoDB automatically handles failover and promotes secondary nodes to primary if the current primary fails.
